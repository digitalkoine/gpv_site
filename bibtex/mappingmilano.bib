	abstract = {This paper presents a pilot project conducted in collaboration with the Fondazione CDEC to shed light on the historical dynamics of the arrests and deportations of Jews from Italy to foreign concentration camps between 1943 and 1945. Led by a multidisciplinary team, including a Digital Humanities expert, an archivist, a GIS developer, and an education manager, the project aimed to rework archival information into data visualisation models utilising a subset of data from the CDEC LOD dataset of the victims of the Holocaust in Italy to construct detailed visual representations of deportation routes.},
